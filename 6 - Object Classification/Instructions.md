# Object Classification with Microsoft REST API

To run this demo, you must complete the following prerequisites:

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Create an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
3. Create an [Computer Vision resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision)
4. Install the [Requests library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
5. Install the [Open CV library](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

For more information, please see the [Azure Computer Vision documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) and the [Computer Vision quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts-sdk/client-library?pivots=programming-language-rest-api&tabs=visual-studio).

Please note that this demo performs both Object Detection and Image Classification as separate steps for educational purposes. Normally, a single call to a computer vision service would perform both steps at once.
