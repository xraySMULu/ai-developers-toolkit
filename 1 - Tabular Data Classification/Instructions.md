# Tabular Data Classification with AutoML

To run this demo, you must complete the following prerequisites:

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
3. Install [AutoKeras](https://autokeras.com/install/)
4. Install [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
5. Install [Scikit Learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)

Please note that Tensorflow can be a bit tricky to install, so I recommend you follow the instructions step-by-step, exactly as specified.

For more information, please see the documentation for (TensorFlow)[https://www.tensorflow.org/learn], [AutoKeras] (https://autokeras.com/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html), and [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html).
